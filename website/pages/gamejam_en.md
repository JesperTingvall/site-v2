# Syltprovning

Get ready for our upcoming event, Syltprovning!
The 20th April at 5:15 PM we will for the first time ever arrange a Syltprovning! This event is aimed at you who are curious about game jams, but are unsure where to begin.
It is also an opportunity for experienced jammers to share their experiences and be nostalgic about jams that have been.

The event will be composed of a short presentation where we present what a jam is, how our jams work, and some anecdotes from old jammers.
This will be followed by some play testing of old game jam games while chilling and talking about game jams, games, and all sorts of things.

The event will be held remotely in [LiU Game Jam's Discord server](https://discord.gg/eHgXYMS).

# What is a game jam?

A game jam is an event where programmers, artists and gamers come together to create games; both computer games and board games.
At our game jam there is a 48 hours time limit and a randomized theme for inspiration.

# FAQ

### Who are welcome?

Everybody is welcome, student and non-student alike. No previous experience is needed and the event is free of charge.

### Where are your events held?

Due to COVID-19 events are held remotely via [LiU Game Jam's Discord server](https://discord.gg/tP2kDvgQKn). We hope to return to physical jams once that is over.

### How are groups selected? Do I need a team?

Groups will be randomized for brainstorming purposes, but you are free to work with whomever you like. The starting groups will allow you to find people sharing similar ideas. We make sure everyone finds someone to work with.

### Do I need to be able to program?

Not at all! Game design covers all kind of fields such as art, music, design, storywriting, level creation and problemsolving. Anyone who is eager to create is welcome.
